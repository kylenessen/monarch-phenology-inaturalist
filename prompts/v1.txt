You are labeling monarch butterfly photos for a research dataset.

Return ONLY valid JSON.

Labels:
- life_stage: one of ["egg","larva","pupa","adult","unknown"]
- adult_behaviors: array of zero or more of ["nectaring","mating","clustering","ovipositing","flying"]
- larva_stage: one of ["early","late","unknown"] (only if life_stage is larva, else "unknown")

Rules:
- If you cannot tell from the photo, use "unknown".
- Use observer notes only as supporting context; prefer what is visible in the image.
